      "Wheel alignment is the process of adjusting the angles of wheels to the car manufacturer specifications. During everyday driving the set angles of the wheels may undergo a considerable variation over time. This could be due to your car’s parts getting worn out over time (E.g. Wearing out of suspension spring), an innocent hit to a curb, an unavoidable pothole, a small accident etc. A wheel alignment restores these angles to their correct settings, making sure your wheels are straight in line with the vehicle and making the right contact with the road. In fact, wheel alignment is an adjustment of the vehicle’s suspension and not an adjustment of the wheels themselves.",

    servicename: "Tyre Rotation",
    description:
      "As you drive your tyres wear out unevenly. Tyre rotation is changing the position of your tyres for more even wear so that they last longer. Front tyres are used for braking and steering. So, they get worn out quickly. Hence, after a period of one year or approximately every 10,000 km they need to be rotated. Rotation helps you to maintain the traction you need to drive more safely and helps increase the life of your tyres. It is recommended to rotate tyres every 5,000 to 10,000 kms. But, you can check in your owner’s manual or with your dealer to know when you can rotate the tyres.",

    servicename: "Nitrogen Filling",
    description:
      "The normal air that you fill in your tyres consists of 78% nitrogen, 21% oxygen and 1% other gases and water. When you fill your tyre with nitrogen the pressure inside the tyre remains stable. This is because the nitrogen molecule is larger than the others, it doesn’t seep out of your tyre quickly. It in fact lasts 3 to 4 times longer than if you didn’t have your tyre filled with nitrogen. Also, nitrogen filled tyre has less water vapor in it unlike compressed air which has a by-product of water. That’s why at high temperature, a tyre full of compressed air will expand much rapidly at an unpredictable rate. But a nitrogen filled tyre will expands at a much slower rate due to the absence of water content.",
