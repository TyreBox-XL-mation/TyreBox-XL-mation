    description:
      "As you drive your tyres wear out unevenly. Tyre rotation is changing the position of your tyres for more even wear so that they last longer. Front tyres are used for braking and steering. So, they get worn out quickly. Hence, after a period of one year or approximately every 10,000 km they need to be rotated. Rotation helps you to maintain the traction you need to drive more safely and helps increase the life of your tyres. It is recommended to rotate tyres every 5,000 to 10,000 kms.",

    description:
      "The normal air that you fill in your tyres consists of 78% nitrogen, 21% oxygen and 1% other gases and water. When you fill your tyre with nitrogen the pressure inside the tyre remains stable. This is because the nitrogen molecule is larger than the others, it doesnâ€™t seep out of your tyre quickly. ",
